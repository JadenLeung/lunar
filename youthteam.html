                    <b>Below is a paragraph written by Bianca Zhang about 2023 LNY MC experiences. Thanks for providing
                        the opportunity!</b><br>

                    When preparing for the Lunar New Year Event, I was given the opportunity to lead a group of students
                    from Artisan’s Dance Academy (ADA) and Lexington High School (LHS) to create a Master of Ceremonies
                    program. Our amazing MC members are Bianca Zhang (ADA/LHS), Grace Li (ADA/LHS), Emma Li (ADA), Sarah
                    Zhang (ADA), Nathan Lim (LHS), Zach Zeaske (LHS), Tammer Haddad (LHS), and Edward Suber (LHS). We
                    collaborated to cover the various themes of the event including: diversity,
                    history, prosperity, and other qualities of Chinese culture. After organizing rehearsal times and
                    making many edits to our scripts we were able to present our hard work on the day of the event,
                    delivering our speeches in both English and Mandarin to an audience of >600 people. Working together
                    with this group was such a wonderful experience and truly a swift process as this was
                    my first time participating in the organization of an event like this one. Everyone was eager to
                    participate in helping share Chinese culture and raising proceeds for the community of Lexington

                    I feel extremely honored and grateful that I was given the opportunity to help share my culture with
                    my community through the art of dance. Leading up to this event, countless hours of practice were
                    put into perfecting formations and details of the many dances that were performed. Artisan’s Dance
                    Academy showcased a variety of dances to express the diversity of Chinese heritage and culture.
                    “Tang Dynasty” tells the story of the liveliness within the artistry which flourished throughout the
                    empire.
                    On the other hand, “Dancing in the Moonlight” emulates the scenery of glimmering reflections cast
                    upon the water in the night. We are proud to see that our performances were very well-received by
                    the audience. Dances and music are truly forms of art without language barrier.
